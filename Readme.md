A 'client' has approached you and asked you to help them build a web presence. They are a local Thai restaurant called Majestic Thai. They don't know anything about the internet, but they know they need a webpage. They want an interactive menu that displays all of their food choices with prices, descriptions, etc. They also want a customer to be able to select menu items and create an order with a total price. When the user saves the order, it should create a new item on the backend so that the kitchen can process the order. The rest is open ended, so feel free to add any additional functionality you want.

Notes

* Use firebase for the backend

Extra

* Create an admin page that gives the owner the ability to view the orders and complete them
* Create a modal contact form that validates the input and saves the information to a contact list
* Make the user login to view the admin page
